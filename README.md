This repository contains data and source code supporting the research paper:

**Artificial Intelligence-Based Solutions for Digital Music Education in 6G Internet of Vehicles (IoV) Networks with Embedded Image Processing Using Convolutional Neural Networks**

---

## Overview
This project presents an artificial intelligence–based multimedia framework for digital music education deployed over next-generation 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. The framework employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for embedded image processing and efficient multimedia content management, while addressing challenges related to latency, security, and resource utilization.

Digital music education is used as a representative multimedia application scenario to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
